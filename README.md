# dna-task-livecoding-nextjs

## Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) v18.17.0+ installed
- Account on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## Setup

After cloning the repository and installing package dependencies run the project (`npm run dev`) and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Introduction & task 1

You have joined a new team as a consultant. The team is building a small eCommerce web app. First MVP was bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v14. There is a home page & a small design-system to be used in the future (you can check the Storybook to see the components).

Take a look at the project and do some review / audit. What do you think? Could it be improved in any way?

## Task 2

The product page is not implemented yet. There is a design prepared on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/CYMl5LDtpBKWxI9D2IjJtp/Hoop!?type=design&node-id=1-443&mode=dev) for the page. There is a stub page defined in `src/app/product/[slug]/page.tsx`. The task is to implement the page.

(Probably there will be not enough time to finish everything, but we would like to see how do you approach working on such tasks)

## Task 3

There are two issues:
- the website is ranking low in Google search results and users are picking other shops over ours. Can we do something to try and improve the ranking and attract more users?
- we were expecting higher amount of users that open our page to make a purchase. Can there be something that the users do not like in our page what discourages them from selecting and buying a product?

What could you propose to solve such issues?
